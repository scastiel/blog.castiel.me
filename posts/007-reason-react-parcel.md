Not that long ago I used Create-React-App a lot to quickly boostrap my React
projects. Thatâ€™s why I naturally used
[Reason Scripts](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-scripts) when I
wanted to use Reason-React. But even if I still understand the advantages of the
approach of CRA and Reason Scripts, I recently discovered
[Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), a very minimalist bundler for web projects.

There are already a lot of articles explaining the advantages of Parcel, and
[how to use it with React](http://blog.jakoblind.no/react-parcel/) for instance.
What I wanted to do here is show you how you can use it to start a new project
with [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/) first, then add
[Reason-React](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react) to write React
components.

_TL;DR: I created a
[project on GitHub](https://github.com/scastiel/parcel-reason-react) containing
the final code for the article, if you just want to see the final result._

## Start a basic Parcel project

First, letâ€™s init a new project with Yarn (NPM should work just fine too) and
add Parcel:

```bash
$ mkdir reason-parcel && cd reason-parcel
$ yarn init -y
$ yarn add --dev parcel-bundler
```

Letâ€™s edit the generated _package.json_ to add the `start` script:

```json
{
  "name": "reason-parcel",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "license": "MIT",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel public/index.html"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "parcel-bundler": "^1.6.2"
  }
}
```

Then letâ€™s create our _public/index.html_ file:

```html
<html>
<body>
  <script src="../src/index.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

And finally letâ€™s add a `src/index.js` file so we can test our first version:

```js
console.log('Hello from JavaScript!');
```

To start the project, letâ€™s just run `yarn start`:

<center>![Hello from JavaScript!](/public/reason-parcel-01.png)</center>

## Add Reason

Okay this was basically the tutorial to start a Parcel project, but where is
Reason? Letâ€™s start by adding `bs-platform` dependency to the project:

```bash
$ yarn add bs-platform
```

Weâ€™ll need a `bsconfig.json` file to tell BuckleScript what to do:

```json
{
  "name": "reason-parcel",
  "refmt": 3,
  "sources": "src",
  "dependencies": []
}
```

Letâ€™s rename out _src/index.js_ file to _src/index.re_ and change its content
to:

```reason
Js.log("Hello from Reason!");
```

To compile the Reason files to JavaScript letâ€™s add the `build` command to our
_package.json_:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel public/index.html",
    "build": "bsb -make-world"
  },
```

Now by running `yarn build`, our _index.re_ file will be transpiled to
JavaScript in _lib/js/src/index.js_. So we need to update our
_public/index.html_ with the new path:

```html
<script src="../lib/js/src/index.js"></script>
```

Letâ€™s start our app now:

<center>![Hello from Reason!](/public/reason-parcel-02.png)</center>

There it is! The workflow is not ideal since you need to start two commands in
different terminals to run your project:

* `yarn build -w` to transpile Reason to JavaScript (the `-w` flag starts the
  _watch_ mode) ;
* `yarn start` to bundle files with Parcel.

If you know a way to make this easier Iâ€™d be glad to hear it and update the
article ðŸ˜‰.

## Add Reason-React

Last step now: adding Reason-React to the project so you can write your
components in Reason. First we need to add the dependency:

```bash
yarn add reason-react
```

We also need to update _bsconfig.json_ to tell BuckleScript weâ€™ll use
Reason-React and JSX:

```json
{
  "name": "reason-parcel",
  "refmt": 3,
  "sources": "src",
  "bs-dependencies": ["reason-react"],
  "reason": {
    "react-jsx": 2
  },
  "dependencies": []
}
```

Now letâ€™s create a simple component in _src/Greeting.re_:

```reason
let component = ReasonReact.statelessComponent("Greeting");

let make = (~name, _children) => {
  ...component,
  render: (_self) =>
    <div>
      (ReasonReact.stringToElement("Hello "))
      <strong> (ReasonReact.stringToElement(name)) </strong>
      (ReasonReact.stringToElement("!"))
    </div>
};
```

Letâ€™s use it in _src/index.re_:

```reason
ReactDOMRe.renderToElementWithId(<Greeting name="Sebastien" />, "root");
```

And finally letâ€™s add a `root` div to our _public/index.html_ to render our
component:

```html
<html>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
  <script src="../lib/js/src/index.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Wow thatâ€™s it! Easy right? Here is what you should get in your browser:

<center>![Hello from Reason!](/public/reason-parcel-03.png)</center>

Now youâ€™re ready to use React to build powerful and maintainable components and
enjoy the possibilities of Reason in the same time. Of course it isnâ€™t the only
way to do so, but I like how elegant the method with Parcel is.

Iâ€™d be curious to know if you see improvements to this workflow. Maybe using
Parcel [packagers](https://parceljs.org/packagers.html) or
[plugins](https://parceljs.org/plugins.html) could make it even cleaner? ðŸ˜‰
